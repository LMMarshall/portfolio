										<h3>Media company: Simulation</h3>
										<p>Modeling editorial processes using random variables in Arena</p>
									</header>
									<p>An online publisher wanted to scale up guest content and planned to hire a new editor with the assumption that the new role would be able to scale content linearly. But being familiar with the editorial process, I saw a likelihood that content production wouldn't scale proportionally to increased manpower.. 
									So in this project, the goal was to use Arena to 1) simulate the existing editorial workflow as a way to get some ground truth on the timing of certain processes and 
									2) use that ground truth to model the workflow of a possible new editor and predict the number of articles they could generate per week.</p>
									<p>I used 8-weeks of prior data on submissions and published stories to generate random variables in simulation program Arena. I also looked at the number of incoming emails queries and the number of stories reviewed but rejected.</p>
									<p>Since there is a lot of variability in these numbers from week to week, I used a Triangular distribution for quite a few of the random variables. The rest I modeled as Normal. (While Poissons might seem like a more obvious choice, they didn't fit the problem for several reasons.)</p>
									<p>You can see an overview of the full workflow below.<b>ADD IMAGE</b><\p>
									<p>Modeling the new workflow was a bit trickier. The existing workflow depended on unsolicited submissions and queries, but the new editor would be tasked with soliciting the majority of their workload. This is why I expected that their productivity would not match that of the existing editor.
									Since no data was available for the new workflow, I relied on my domain knowledge to set reasonable parameters. Since articles can take more than a week to go through the editorial cycle, I simulated 10 working days and divided the output in half to get reasonable output for a 5-day work week.</p>
