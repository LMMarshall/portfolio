										<h3>Media company: Simulation</h3>
										<p>Modeling editorial processes using random variables in Arena</p>
									</header>
									<p><strong>Problem.</strong> An online publisher has a guest writer program, which takes a lot of editorial time to make possible. One editor was running the program part-time, handling hundreds of emails and submissions sent to the guest-post inbox each week. The company wanted to scale up this program and wanted to know if hiring an additional full-time editor would result in enough extra content to make the investment worthwhile.  Since the existing editor was already handling all unsolicited mail coming to the inbox, the new editor's role would be different: They would need to actively solicit new content. This would be a more time-consuming means of sourcing content, so the concern was that the editor's time cost might outweigh the value they would be able to generate.</p>

									<p><strong>Data modeling approach. </strong>I chose to answer the question through a simulating the processes in Arena. Specifically, I built 2 models:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>A model of the existing editorial workflow, which I adjusted until it represented the actual productivity and work times of the existing editor. The would provide some ground truth on the timing of various editorial processes.</li>
										<li>A model of the proposed new workflow for the additional editor. The distributions and parameters used in this model leveraged the learnings from the first model to predict the number of articles the new editor would likely be able to generate per week.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>I used 8 weeks of prior data on submissions and published stories &mdash in addition to my own familiarity with the process &mdash to generate the random variables.</p>
									
									<p><strong>Results.</strong> The simulation estimated that, if the company hired the new editor, they would be able to produce 10.4 stories a week, 24% more output than the existing editor was producing (the equivalent of 8.4 stories per full-time week), assuming an equivalent skill level and work pace. This outcome gave the executive team confidence that a new hire would indeed be a tenable move.</p>								</div>
