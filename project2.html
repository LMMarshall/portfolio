										<h3>Seattle Police: Time-series forecasting</h3>
										<p>A big data project using OpenRefine for data cleaning, PySpark in Google Cloud for data manipulation and feature engineering, and ARIMA forecasting.</p>
									</header>
									<p><b>Objective.</b> The Seattle Police Department faced substantial challenges in managing its policing resources in 2020, when it was one of the first (and hardest-hit) U.S. cities to face COVID-19 and shortly afterwards was hit by mass Black Lives Matter protests, which led to the forced shutdown of the East Precinct station and calls to defund the police.</p>
									<p>The goal of this project was to use police call data from the City of Seattle's Open Data project to:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Build a machine-learning model that would predict 2020 police call acitivity based on 10 years of historical data. This would provide a baseline by which to measure the impacts of COVID-19 and the protests.</li>
										<li>Compare that expected outcome with the actual police call activity for 2020 to gauge the impact of these events on policing behaviors and police resource utilization.</li>
									</ol>
									<p><b>Approach.</b> The key elements of the project were as follows:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>4.3 million rows</strong> of police call data</li>
										<li><strong>OpenRefine</strong> for fixing naming inconsistencies in the data and aggregating similar categories</li>
										<li><strong>Google Cloud + PySpark</strong> for feature engineering, cleaning, and aggretating data</li>
										<li><strong>Python</strong> notebook for final cleaning</li>
										<li>45 seasonal <strong>ARIMA models</strong> to support forecasting (9 features X 5 precincts) and used ADF test for stationarity</li>
										<li>Coordination with JavaScript programmers designing an <strong>interactive tool</strong> powered by my data and models
										<li>Creation of easy-to-follow <strong>feature descriptions</strong> to give users of the tool context on how each feature had been built from the underlying data.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>Above: Simple feature descriptions to preserve critical context for people using the tool.</p>

									</header>
									<p><b>Results.</b> The resulting tool surfaced a number of interesting insights that could help inform police resource planning during times of social upheaval. For example:</p>
									<div class = "list">
									<ul>
										<li>The proportion of calls resulting in no police action surged from January to August by 35%, potentially costing time and resources that could have been allocated elsewhere</li>
										<li>Average police response time increased by 87% from January to Augist, 2020</li>
										<li>Arrest numbers across the city dropped by 21% from January to April, 2020 (the initial months of COVID-19 before the BLM protests
									began). During the same period, total police action declined by almost 10%.</li>
										<li>The ratio of public-initiated calls for help to police-initiated calls increased by 257% between January and August 2020, even as calls poured in to defund the police. The East precinct saw a much steeper increase in this metric of 482%.</li>
									</ul></div>
									
									<p>As mentioned above, my features and ARIMA models were used to power an interactive visualization tool. A 6-minute demo video of that tool follows below.</p>
