										<h3>Seattle Police: Anomaly detection</h3>
										<p>A big data project using PySpark with Google Cloud, OpenRefine for data cleaning, extensive feature engineering, ARIMA forecasting</p>
									</header>
									<p></b>Objective.</b> The Seattle Police Department faced substantial challenges in managing its policing resources in 2020 when it was one of the first (and hardest-hit) U.S. cities to face COVID-19 and shortly afterwards was hit by mass Black Lives Matter protests, which led to the forced shutdown of East Precinct station and calls to defund the police.</p>
									<p>The goal of this project was to use police call data from the City of Seattle's Open Data project to:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>Build a machine-learning model that would predict 2020 police call acitivity based on 10 years of historical data. This would provide a baseline by which to measure the impact of COVID and the protest.</li>
										<li>Compare that expected outcome with the actual police call activity for 2020 to gauge the impact of these events on police resource utilization.</li>
										<li>Construct a tool that would allow police and public users to interact with this data and easily view the impacts at various levels of granularity.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Summary of my approach:</p>
									<ul>
										<li><strong>4.3 million rows</strong> of police call data with 11 features</li>
										<li>Used <strong>OpenRefine</strong> to fix tagging inconsistencies in the data and aggregate similar categories</li>
										<li>Used <strong>Google Cloud + PySpark</strong> for feature engineering, cleaning, and aggretating data</li>
										<li>Used <strong>Python Jupyter notebook</strong> for final cleaning</li>
										<li>Built 45 seasonal <strong>ARIMA models</strong> to support forecasting (9 features X 5 precincts) and used ADF test for stationarity</li>
										<li>Wrote accessible <strong>feature descriptions for users</strong> to provide critical context on how each feature had been built from the underlying data.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>The resulting tool, demoed in the 6-minute video below, surfaced a number of interesting insights that could help inform police resource planning during times of social upheaval. For example:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>The proportion of calls resulting in no police action surged from Jan to Aug by 35%, potentially costing time and resources that could have been allocated elsewhere</li>
										<li>Average police response time increased by 87% to from Jan to Aug, 2020</li>
										<li>Arrest numbers across the city dropped by 21% from Jan to April, 2020 (the initial months of COVID-19 before the BLM protests
									began). During the same period, total police action declined by almost 10%.</li>
										<li>The ratio of public calls for help to police-initiated calls increased by 257% between Jan and Aug 2020 just as calls poured in to defund the police. The East precinct saw a much steeper increase of 482%.</li>
									</ul>
