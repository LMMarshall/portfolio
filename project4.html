										<h3>Public Health England: Regression</h3>
										<p>Finding the best regression approach for predicting cancer deaths in UK communities.</p>
									</header>
									<p><p><strong>Objective.</strong> Using public health data from across England, see if deaths from cancer in a local authority area can be somewhat accurately predicted using a variety of health and community markers.</p>

									<p><strong>Approach.</strong> I accessed Public Health England's 'Fingertips' dataset via its API (using the custom Python library fingertips_py) and selected 45 health and environmental markers across 299 regions of the country. The markers included rates of noise level, indoor air quality, education achievement, pollution, obesity, sexually-transmitted diseases, and more. My goal was two-fold:</p>
									<ol>
										<li>To determine if it is indeed possible to predict rates of cancer deaths with some accuracy based on these kinds of community markers.</li>
										<li>To identify any specific features that have strong explanatory power and may thus be explored as potential contributing factors to cancer deaths -- or at least to environments that result in higher cancer deaths.</li>
									</ol>
							
									<p><strong>Process.</strong> I used transformations and a variety of different models. Specifically:<ul><li>Used a postcode API to impute missing values by geographic region rather than nationwide average.</li>
									<li>Used PowerTransformer to reduce skew and scale features.</li>
									<li>Ran a number of models to find the strongest predictor: linear regression, LASSO, Ridge regression, Elastic Net, Poisson regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, and TensorFlow neural network. Also used PCA.</li><li>Separately, used LASSO, a simple decision tree, and linear regression plots to hone in on features with the clearest explanatory power.</li></ul>

									</header>
									<p><strong>Results.</strong> The best-performing model, a Random Forest model run on a subset of features and using PCA, was able to account for 47% of the variation in cancer death rates across regions, making it a useful predictor.<\p><p>The features that showed the most explanatory power were cardiovascular death rates, respiratory death rates, and rates of mental disorders. Rates of high educational attainment and hospitalisation for alcohol-related problems also ranked high.<\p>
